    </head>

    <body>
    My name is Isabella Kornberg but most people call me Belle.
    I am currently a junior in Newhouse with a Graphic Design major and an IDS minor in the iSchool.
    I have always had a very visual eye and prefer hands on learning than memorization: I love being creative.
    I love to test my limits and learn new skills, which is precisely why I chose to take IST263 this semester.
    Ideally, I would like to combine my design skills with web development and learn how to use the two to my advantage by the end of the semester.

    I would consider myself talented in the design field with a strong skillset in the Adobe programs. I have a strong passion for the fashion industry and hope to pursue a career in this field once I graduate in 2024.
    Outside of school, I am a girl full of love. I believe that family is the most important thing and everyone tends to joke with me aboout how much I am on the phone, filling in those I care about on my day.
    I am the only American-born in an all British family. Having been born and raised in Columbus, Ohio, I am a true midwestern girl. I have been lucky enough to have a diverse background with family all around the world and been fortunatee nough to travel to these places.

    I am so excited to learn new skills in this course and once thing you should know about me is that I ask A LOT of questions!
