    <h1>Belle Kornberg's Biography</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        I am currently a junior in Newhouse with a <strong>Graphic Design</strong> major and an IDS minor in the iSchool.
        I have always had a very visual eye and prefer hands on learning rather than memorization. I love being creative and allowing my mind to guide me to an end result with classwork.
    </p>

    <p>
    I love to test my limits and learn new skills, which is precisely why I chose to take IST263 this semester.
    Ideally, I would love to combine my design skills with web development techniques and use the two to my advantage by the end of the semester.
    </p>

    <h3>Some of my skills include being:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Organized</li>
        <li>Creative</li>
        <li>Assertive</li>
        <li>Responsible</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h2>Personal Information</h2>

    <p>
    I would consider myself talented in the design field with a strong skillset in the Adobe programs. I have a strong passion for the fashion industry and hope to pursue a career in this field once I graduate in May 2024.
    </p>
    <p>
    Outside of school, I am a girl full of love. I believe that family is the most important thing. My friends even joke with me aboout how much I am on the phone, filling in those I care about on my day.
    I am the only American-born in an all British family. Having been born and raised in Columbus, Ohio, I am a true midwestern girl. I have been lucky enough to have a diverse background with family all around the world and been fortunate enough to travel to these places.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I am so excited to learn new skills in this course and I already feel myself becoming more comfortable with the material.
    </p> 

    <p>
        One thing that you should know about me is that I tend to ask A LOT of questions!
