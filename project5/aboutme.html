<h3>About Me</h3>

        Hi! My name is Belle Kornberg and I am so glad that you have found my page. <br>
        <br>
Having been born and raised in Columbus, Ohio, a fashion powerhouse, I have been immersed in this industry from a young age. I have a strong passion for fashion and want to share this with others.<br>
<br>
I am a Junior at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications with a major in Graphic Design, and a minor in the iSchool. <br>
<br>
As far as experience goes, I have been a design intern at a big retailer and have learned a lot from this. I helped design the clothing for upcoming seasons, participated in design department meetings, and learned from well-trained professionals.<br>
<br>
I created this platform to enlighten others with my strong fascination. I hope to help those who may feel lost in the world of fashion, or want inspiration. I also hope to spread awareness of influencers and brands that people may not be aware of.<br>
<br>
Ideally, I would like to combine my graphic design skills with my love of fashion and my newly developed skills in front-end web development to create an application that contains all of the content on this page, but is also interactive as a social network. People could meet people from around the world through their shared interests and love of the fashion world.<br>
<br>
