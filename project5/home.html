    <h2>Cargo Pants</h2>
    <h3>Why all the craze?</h3>
<p>If you're like me, you like to keep it simple on top. I think I own 3 of the same staple shirts in my closet (obviously only the color black), and accessorize it with other pieces of clothing: lately, it's been cargo pants. Let's face it, the y2k low-rise trends are back in, so it is our time to either own it and rock it, or ignore it and carry-on with our daily lives. I don't know what specifically brought cargos back in style, but trust me, they're back. What better way to add a touch to your perfect
    outfit than some patterned cargos, plain color, or cargo sweats? They have pockets, they're not skin tight, and they make you stand out! What more could you want? Below are some links to my personal favorites!

    <h2>Bomber Jackets</h2>
    <h3>Why all the craze?</h3>
    <p>Maybe it's because “Top Gun: Maverick” has taken over, or it's because these jackets are genuinely cool, but bomber jackets and aviator-type fashion will be everywhere this fall. Name a better jacket for a crisp fall day to go on top of your hoodie? These jackets have been in many runway shows and all over some of the biggest retailers' sites. Get your hands on one fast before people catch up to you!</p>

<h1>Make Me an Outfit</h1>
<h2>Say less. I mean, that's what I'm here for, right?</h2>
<p>Let's talk about college fall fashion. Afterall, it is not Milan Fashion Week, but many people (including myself) like to dress to impress. Below you will find some of my favorite staples for class and a night out, or for a date night with someone you love.
</p>

<h3>For Class</h3>
<img src="../proj5images/class-outfit.jpg" alt="class-outfit" width=400px height=auto> <br>
<p>
    Starting off casual: you roll out of bed and crave an iced latte from Starbucks. What do you wear? In my eyes, this could go one of two ways. You could either get a coffee and go to the library to do some work, or you can go back to bed (really just depends on the day, right?) Above is an outfit which has you looking chic and ready for your day. All items linked below. <br>

<h3>For a Night Out</h3>
    <img src="../proj5images/night-out.jpg" alt="night-out" width=400px height=auto><br>
<p>
    In my opinion, there's no better feeling that being comfortable and feeling <strong>confident</strong>. Here I am wearing a simple black dress that is not too dressy but not too casual for a night out on the town. Throw this on with a pair of sneakers and you'll be sure to have a great night. Accesorize it with some fun jewlery and you'll be on your way! All items linked below <br>
