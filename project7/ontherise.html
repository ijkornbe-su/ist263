                <h3>WGSN</h3>
        <p><a href="https://wgsn.com">WGSN</a> is an exclusive site which is focused on trend forecasting. Here you can
                find trend predictions for seasons up to 2024 (crazy, right?). For someone who wants to get involved in the fashion industry or who wants some more knowledge of it, this site is essentially your fashion bible. The information is backed up with data and it holds countless pieces of content. It could take you a year to fully dive into all of the statistics.

                    world of fashion happens. Especially during any Fashion Week, this site is your source to everything you need. There are deep reviews of any shows, new releases, or designers. It is a comprehensive guide to fashion and beauty. You can search by the designer or by season to see any look from any show that you want to engage with.

WWD is essentially your news network for fashion. They post breaking news in the industry, constant updates, and reviews. If you are interested in getting more
                involved with the day-to-day updates and trends, this will be your main source of knowledge. Above is a video from their YouTube which captures Tommy Hilfiger's "Homecoming Spectacular"
